# SQLServerBasicBuild
This is a very basic build of SQL Server. This assumes no knowledge as to what may be placed on it, no knowledge of expected load, and should be tweaked for your own standards. Basic setup for your checklist is to place all of these files into a folder such as "New SQL Builds" or "Build Checklist". Within that folder, create another folder called "Builds" and move _BuildChecklist - Template.xlsx into that folder. Save all future builds in that folder in order for links to open scripts in the parent folder.
